# Computer-Vision-CS-527

This repository revisits the core classical (i.e., non-deep learning) concepts in the course in one dimension (specifically, images are one-dimensional and the world is two-dimensional).

This is created as a part of CS527: Computer Vision course at Duke University. 

The notebooks contain the following topics in detail:

1. 1D convolution and correlation (Link:)

2. 1D smoothing

3. 1D differentiation

4. 1D pyramids

5. 1D window tracking

6. Rigid transformations in 2D

7. 1D pinhole camera

8. 1D epipolar geometry 

9. 2D reconstruction from 1D images

# Computer-Vision-CS-527

This repository revisits the core classical (i.e., non-deep learning) concepts in the course in one dimension (specifically, images are one-dimensional and the world is two-dimensional).

I created these notebooks as a part of the CS 527, a graduate-level course on Computer Vision, offered by the CS department at Duke University, taught by Professor Carlo Tomasi. These notebooks serve as code implementation of the concepts he taught during lectures.  

The notebooks contain the following topics in detail:

1. 1D convolution and correlation

2. 1D smoothing

3. 1D differentiation

4. 1D pyramids

5. 1D window tracking

6. Rigid transformations in 2D

7. 1D pinhole camera

8. 1D epipolar geometry 

9. 2D reconstruction from 1D images

I enjoyed taking the course. I hope you will get to learn a thing or two from my notebooks.
